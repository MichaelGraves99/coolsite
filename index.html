      <p> You only think I guessed wrong!
        That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one

          has
          studied his Agrippa... which I have. Move? You're alive. If you want I can fly. You just shook your head...
          doesn't
          that make you happy? Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. Probably he means no *harm*.</p>
